* architecture
Two kinds of facts:
ground truth (state) / derived knowledge (views)

# Rules:
- state transitions:
  depend on both ground truth & derived knowledge, change ground truth

- view rules:
  depend on ground truth & derived knoweldge, define derived knowledge

# Other notes:
- inputs: affect ground truth by introducing new facts
  (SENSE PREDICATES)

- outputs: certain linear facts are consumed by the outside world as messages
  (ACTION PREDICATES)

- views: a live view of the system can hopefully be defined as a view that is
  interpreted somehow by the external system.
  (DISPLAY PREDICATES)

# Problems:
- does derived knowledge forward-chain? backward-chain?
  how to avoid circularity, or permit it in a reasonable manner?

- how can we efficiently re-calculate views when ground truth changes?
  (Eve had to tackle this, look at how they did it.)

# Questions:
- is there any logical story for the relation between ground truth & derived
  knowledge? ground truth acts linearly within itself, but derived knowledge
  doesn't change it. what's up with that?

- is there some relation to temporal logic here?

- do we have any guarantee that outside inputs will get processed? Ceptre
  achieves this by having separate "phases" (which seem like syntax sugar, but
  maybe useful syntax sugar!) and then being able to detect if an outside input
  hasn't been processed within the right phase.

- (how) do we distinguish inputs/outputs/displayable-views from ordinary facts?
  in Ceptre, program declares things as {predicates, sense, action}.
  in Quelle: {state, sense, action, view, display}?

* example applications
games:
- chess
- snake
- asteroids
- IFs, roguelikes

web server
build system
code analysis (eg. liveness)
dice roller
D&D stats calculator / game assistant
* implementation
one option for a decent prototype would be to do it in Elm!
if Elm is too slow, could do JS backend / Elm frontend.
