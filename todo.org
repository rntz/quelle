* include some builtin functions in parser
* have way to escape into racket
* symbols?
symbols can be thought of as just 0-ary constructors.
OTOH, this makes functions which manipulate symbols much uglier.

could define a special-purpose type that includes "all zero-ary constructors",
but that's very ad-hoc & makes the lattice of types... weird. also, it will
never(?) be inferred - unless used as an argument. which might be fine, in a
sense?

* add type-ascription form
* future work
** more powerful pattern language
*** equality constraints
** record types
** polymorphism
** pretty-printer
** optimizations
** a real parser
